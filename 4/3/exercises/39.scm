; The order of restrictions should not change the answers.
; The performance might change slightly depending on the order of
; restrictions. 
; In the appartment example the distinct check happens before
; any other requirement is applied. This check is quite expensive
; compared to the checks for adjacency and floor restrictions.
; If the requirements were changed so that the lighter restrictions
; were applied first, it would slightly reduce the number of expensive
; requirement checks and therefore slightly increase performance.
